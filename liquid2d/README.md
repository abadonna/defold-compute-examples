# Liquid simulation

Attempt to reproduce [video by Sebastian Lague](https://youtu.be/rSKMYc1CQHE?si=3oE1KMeIPU83HOOW) with Defold compute shaders.

This project contains bitonic sort for optimization and can process any number of particles.

For the basic approach - check "liquid2d simple" project.
